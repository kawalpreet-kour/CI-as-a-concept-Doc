## What is CI?

Continuous Integration (CI) has become an indispensable practice in modern software development, helping teams streamline their workflow, reduce bugs, and enhance overall project efficiency. CI involves the automation of various phases throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring that code changes are regularly integrated into a shared repository. CI enables early detection of issues and faster, reliable software delivery.

## Why Use CI?

| Reason                          | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Early Bug Detection             | Catch issues at an early stage to reduce cost and effort of fixes           |
| Faster Feedback                 | Developers get quick insights on code quality and test results              |
| Reliable Codebase               | Ensures that code in the main branch is always in a deployable state       |
| Collaboration                   | Encourages team coordination and consistent coding practices               |

## CI Workflow

| Phase / Step            | Description                                                                 | Recommended Tools                         |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Start – Developer Push  | Developer writes code, commits locally, and pushes to central repo          | Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket           |
| CI Trigger              | Pipeline starts automatically or manually                                    | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI |
| Pre-Build Phase         | Compile code, credential scan, dependency & license check, static analysis, code coverage | javac, GCC, SonarQube, TruffleHog, GitLeaks, JaCoCo, Snyk |
| Build Phase             | Dependency resolution, artifact generation, unit testing, code quality checks | Maven, Gradle, Docker, JUnit, ESLint    |
| Post-Build Phase        | Health check, sanity test, functional test, integration test, DAST          | Selenium, Cypress, Postman, OWASP ZAP   |
| Decision Point          | All checks passed? Yes → Deploy, No → Feedback, Fix & Notify team           | Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Slack, Email |
| Deployment              | Deploy artifact to staging or production                                    | AWS, Docker, Kubernetes,  Azure    |
| Monitoring & Alerts     | Track build/deploy status, performance metrics, send notifications on failure or success | Slack, Email, Teams, Grafana, Prometheus |
